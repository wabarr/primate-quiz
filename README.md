## New (to me) django techniques in this project

* Use [django-mobile] (https://github.com/gregmuellegger/django-mobile) middleware to serve mobile version of content
* simple tweak to views.py to toggle variable 'useGoogleAnalytics' based on current user permissions.  Use this variable in template to prevent tracking admin visits to the site
* serve amazon.com ads
